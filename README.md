Tired of not being able to build a cool dock from the shores to the depths, a massive landbridge across the seas, or even an underwater city? Get the Seafloor Walking Boots! Equip them to traverse the seafloor in safety and build your dreams from the ground up!

I don't recommend you equip them and jump into the water, as fall damage is still a thing. Feel free to unequip them and float to the surface, assuming that you don't think you'll drown. By default, you cannot requip the boots if you are swimming.

# How to Install/Uninstall
