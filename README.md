# DeeMainiac's Valheim mods

Here's my valheim mods. Each one of them has a folder, but all of their 'assets' are in the Assets folder.

# Seafloor Walking Boots
Small mod. Adds special craftable boots to walk on the bottom of the sea with.

Requires [JÃ¶tunn](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1138).

You can also find it here on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1580/?tab=description).

Tired of not being able to build a cool dock from the shores to the depths, a massive bridge across the seas, or even an underwater city? Get the Seafloor Walking Boots! Equip them to traverse the seafloor in safety and build your dreams from the ground up!

I don't recommend you equip them and jump into the water, as fall damage is still a thing. Feel free to unequip them and float to the surface, assuming that you don't think you'll drown.

I don't plan on making the resources balanced really, since they're quite OP and defeat the purpose of boats to cross bodies of water.

## How to Install/Uninstall
Download __SeafloorWalkingBoots.dll__ and place it in your BepInEx/plugins folder.

To Uninstall, delete __SeafloorWalkingBoots.dll__.
